It's for my 1st experience and learning how to upload a file in github

1. Go to your profile touch the + symbol followed by that touch create new repository

2. A screen will open give a name to ypur repositary and touch initialize with a README 

3. Your repositary will be open

4. Select upload file followed by that select choose your file

5. Select the files you want to upload, if you want type your message for your reference

6. Click commit changes button

Hurray!!! You have sucessfully created your repositary and uploaded a file.
